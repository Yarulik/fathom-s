#Fathom-S

The Fathom Tether Boards are part of Blue Robotics' *Fathom Tether*. These boards provide interfaces and functionality for the communication methods used with the tether. With the Fathom tether, it is quick and easy to get up and running and interface with your ROV or other application.

The schematic and board layout are designed in EagleCAD.

#Fathom-S (Serial) Hardware

##Description

The Fathom-S Hardware is designed for applications using a simple microcontroller for ROV control. It is meant to be an all-inclusive tether interface. 

The Fathom-S Hardware is designed to be used with tether cables that have four twisted pairs, preferrably similar to Cat5 cable. The design is based on the tether cables available from Blue Robotics, but will also work with standard Cat5 network cable.

##Features 

* Low Latency Analog Video through NTSC or PAL (1000+ ft, 300+ m)
* Full-duplex RS-422 serial connection with TTL and USB connections (up to 250 Kbps, 4000 ft, 1200 m)
* Power switch that uses a 3-50V input signal to turn on interface (and optionally the autopilot and/or a high power switch/relay)
* Onboard 5V and 12V (camera) regulated supplies
* Jumpers to enable/disable configuration options
	* Power-on through tether / power always on when batteries connected
	* Power cycle on USB RTS signal for Arduino programming
* DroneCode Mini Compatible JST-GH and DF13 connectors

##APM/PixHawk Adapter Board

The APM/PixHawk Adapter Board allows the Fathom-S board to be interfaced directly to a PixHawk or any other DroneCode compatible autopilot. The following connectors are available:

* Telemetry serial port to the tether RS422 serial port (via 0.1" header, DF13, or JST-GH)
