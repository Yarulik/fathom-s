# Fathom-S

The Fathom Tether Boards are part of Blue Robotics' *Fathom Tether*. These boards provide interfaces and functionality for the communication methods used with the tether. With the Fathom tether, it is quick and easy to get up and running and interface with your ROV or other application.

The schematic and board layout are designed in EagleCAD.
